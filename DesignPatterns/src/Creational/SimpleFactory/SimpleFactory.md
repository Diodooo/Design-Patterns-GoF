# Simple Factory

It's one of the Creational Patterns, but it's not considered an "official" Creational Pattern.

## Usage

- Hides the creation details of class instantiation.
- A client asks for something, and based on that "something", a SimpleFactory class will return the corresponding object.
- Always works with interfaces/abstractions.
